            <Para>This game was created by me <a href="mailto:lucasmace4130@gmail.com">Lucas Mace</a>,
                a bicycle nerd, for other bicycle nerds.</Para>
            <Para>I have been a bicycle mechanic for over 10 years. In that time, my favorite game that
                I have played with my many co-workers has been handing them a small part and telling them to
                "Name this part." If the first mechanic couldn't get it, the next would want to try. Then, we'd
                all probably play for the rest of the day.</Para>
            <Para>I knew that I could recreate this fun into an intrenet game that people would want to play.
                I enjoy writing code in my spare time, and take freelance work when it comes my way. For this project
                I chose to build with React, GraphQL, MySQL, Express and Styled Components.</Para>
            <Para>This project has already gone through a rigourus prototype and beta testing phase,
                but if you find an error or bug along the way, please email
                me <a href="mailto:lucasmace4130@gmail.com">here</a> and I will try to take care of it.
                All photos are taken by me and I try to add parts to the game every week. So if you'd like
                to keep your high score, check back often.
            </Para>
            <Para>This project has also been fact checked. If you think that a part is mislabled or that you should 
                have gotten a correct answer, look it up before emailing me.
            </Para>
            <Para>If you'd like to use this game as an interview tool or use your high score on 
                your resume, please go right ahead! 
            </Para>
            <Para>If you enjoy the game, please share it with your bicycle nerd friends.</Para>
            <Para>This project is funded completely on my own.</Para>
